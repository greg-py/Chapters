## Development

### Error Handling Pattern

This application uses a standardized error handling pattern to reduce duplicate try/catch blocks across command handlers. The implementation is in `src/utils/errors.ts` and provides a higher-order function `withErrorHandling` that wraps command handlers.

Example usage:

```typescript
app.command(
  "/chapters-command",
  withErrorHandling(async ({ command, ack, client }) => {
    await ack();

    // Your command logic here...
    // No need for try/catch blocks!

    await client.chat.postEphemeral({
      channel: command.channel_id,
      user: command.user_id,
      text: "Command completed successfully",
    });
  })
);
```

Benefits:

- Reduces code duplication
- Ensures consistent error responses
- Centralizes error logging
- Makes command handlers more readable
